# omnifood

I have done this project in november 2023. It was part of curriculum of course by Jonas Schmedtmann on udemy which I used to learn HTML/CSS and web design. I have tried to make exact replica of the omnifood project @ www.omnifood.dev.

In this project I have applied & learnt CSS including flexbox and CSS Grid for layout
Important CSS concepts such as the box model, positioning schemes, inheritance, solving selector conflicts, etc.
A web design framework with easy-to-use rules and guidelines to design eye-catching websites.
How to plan, sketch, design, build & optimize a professional website.
Made page responsive by using @media query.
